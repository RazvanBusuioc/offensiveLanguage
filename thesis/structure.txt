1. Introduction


2. State of the art

	2.1. Datasets and Methods for offensive speech

		2.1.1. Hate Speech and Offensive Language
			- https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/hate-speech-and-offensive-language
			- should talk about how it was computed - see homepage
			- should talk about it s classes
			- should talk about the fact that every text is annotated by > 3 ppl
			- extract info from their papers!!!!

		2.1.2. Hate Speech
			- https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/hate-speech
			- https://paperswithcode.com/paper/hate-speech-dataset-from-a-white-supremacy
			- should talk about how it was computed - see homepage
			- should talk about it s classes - binary class
			- should talk about the source of the dataset - neonazist forum
			- extract info from their papers!!!!
		
		2.1.3. OLID (Offensive Language Identification Dataset)
			- https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/olid
			- https://scholar.harvard.edu/malmasi/olid
			- should talk about how it was computed - see homepage
			- should talk about it s classes - 3 class categories
			- extract info from their papers!!!!
		
	2.2 Text classification

		2.2.1 Classical ML

			2.2.1.1. Classifiers

				- Naive Bayes
				- Random Forest
				- XGBoost
				- SVM
			
			2.2.1.2. Neural Networks

				- CNN
				- RNN
				- LSTM
				- GRU

		2.2.2 Bert based architectures

				-TODO

	2.3 Frameworks

		2.3.1. tensorflow
		2.3.2. Scikit learn
		2.3.3. Spacy

3. Method

	3.1 Corpora
		- shouold talk about the diff between the datasets

		3.1.1 ROOffense 
			- should ask Andrei about it
			- should talk about how it was computed, features, etc

		3.1.2 fbROOffense

			3.1.2.1. Data extraction
				- talk about all the trials - wikipedia, local newspapers, etc
				- talk about political facebook broadcasts wide variety of language
				- talk about inaboradibility of facebook api -> selenium library
				- talk about selenium and the method for extraction
				- talk about all 30k gathered comments and how we narrowed them down to ~8k
				- talk about labeling the comments:
					- coarse grained
					- fine grained
				- talk about labeling rules and exceptions
			
			3.1.2.2. Graphs, Distribution, etc
				- all kind of metrics
			
			3.1.2.3 Scoring rubric
				- ask for more details about this chapter??

	3.2 Neural architectures / Workflow


4. Results

	- 1st step of learning -> ROOffense dataset
		- accuracy table for all the models
		- coarse grained confusion matrix for the best (and the 2nd best maybe)
		- fine grained confusion matrix for the best (and the 2nd best maybe)
		- talk about problems, overcomed things, etc.
		- maybe present a tiny user interface with the product

	- 2nd step of learning -> ROOffense dataset
		- accuracy table for all the models
		- coarse grained confusion matrix for the best (and the 2nd best maybe)
		- fine grained confusion matrix for the best (and the 2nd best maybe)
		- talk about problems, overcomed things, etc.
		- maybe present a tiny user interface with the product

	- talk about problems with the model.(ce detecteaza gresit si de ce)

5. Discussions
	- Benefits
	- Drawbacks
	- Problems encountered
		- talk about data extraction - had to keep an eye on political figures in order to run the script when they started broadcasting
		- talk about data annotation - many corner case, A LOT of misspelling


6. Conclusions and future work
